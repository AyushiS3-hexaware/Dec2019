Pending Leave means 

Assume 1000 is manager for 2000 and 3000 employees 

then once he enter as 1000 then he needs to see pending leaves of

2000 and 3000

based on that he needs to take care of action. 

Validations for ApplyLeave
__________________________

   1) LeaveBalance need to be there 

   2) LeaveStartDate must be less than or equal to LeaveEnddate

   3) LeaveStarDate not yesterdays' date (means no prev dates)
 
   4) No overloapping of day to be entertained 

	Assume, you applied from

	April 10 2020 to April 18 2020

	Then again you try to apply leave on April 15 then it is 

	called overlapping because already one leave records exists
	on this period. 

   5) Top level manager leave needs to be approved automatically as leaveStatus for him is APPROVED always (Auto Approval)

   	Assume, Employee 1000 is CEO for his no pending leaves.
	Remaining employees by default PENDING.


	Once leaveApplied please deduct the leaveBalance. 


Validations for ApproveDeny 

	He is authorized manager to the employee to approve or not
	Example 1000 is manager for 2000 and 3000, then employee 2000 leave not to be 
	approved by 1001 even he is manager (because he is unauthorized for this employ) 


/**
    * return count for already applied leave history.
    * @param empId the id of the employee.
    * @param leaStDate of the start date.
    * @param leaEndDate of the end date.
    * @return total records.
    */
  @SqlQuery("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM LEAVE_DETAILS WHERE LEA_EMP_ID = :empId"
        +
        " AND LEA_LEAVE_STATUS = 'PENDING' AND "
        +
        " (LEA_START_DATE <= :leaStDate AND LEA_END_DATE >= :leaStDate OR "
        +
        "LEA_START_DATE <= :leaEndDate AND LEA_END_DATE >= :leaEndDate)")
    int count(@Bind("empId") int empId,
                      @Bind("leaStDate") String leaStDate,
                      @Bind("leaEndDate") String leaEndDate);




SELECT COUNT(*) FROM LEAVE_DETAILS WHERE EMP_ID=1000 AND LEAVE_STATUS='PENDING'
AND (LEAV_STARTDATE <='2020-04-15' AND LEAVE_ENDDATE >= '2020-04-15' OR
     LEAVE_STARTDATE <='2020-04-16' AND LEAVE_ENDDATE >= '2020-04-16) 

  
But assume, you already applied previous from April 10 2020 to April 20 2020 

then the above query returns count as 1 because already 1 record found in DB.
