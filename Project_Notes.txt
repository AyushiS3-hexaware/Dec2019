Properties are used to define the internal behaviour of the particular entity. if you want to represent any variable a field, then we need the help of properties. we have getter() and setter() 

getter() for reading the value
setter() for assign the value. 

toString() : 

java.lang.Object class have predefined methods as

equals()
hashCode()
toString() 

which we can override. 

toString() contains the list of values to be printed when we print the object. 

This method will be called automatically once we print the object. 

Ex :

Customer obj = new Customer();

System.out.println(obj);

then it calls toString() method of Customer class

hashCode() : It returns memory location address number, you can override this method as all values of the particular class object are same, then we can return same hashCode() number. 

This can be achieved by using Objects.hash()

equals() : Checks the values of the paritcular class object and returns true or false. 

How to print the class name from object : 

getClass() 

A constructor is a special member, that which allows you to initialize the member variables of the class, it is special because it has the same name as that of class name. 

Rules : 
________

   1) It will not return any value. 
   2) It will not contains any return type. 
   3) It will be invoked automatically once 
	instance of the class created. 
   4) A constructor can be overloaded.
